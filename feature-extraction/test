 Back to Latest FDA Approvals Boniva is the first-ever oral treatment administered as one tablet once a month for any chronic disease. With once-monthly Boniva, an effective bisphosphonate, patients would take 12 tablets a year versus 52 required with current weekly bisphosphonate treatments. Developed in response to patient need, once-monthly Boniva was approved based on a supplemental new drug application. Once-monthly oral Boniva is not currently approved for use outside of the U.S., although it is undergoing regulatory review in markets across the world, including Europe, where it will be marketed under the trademark Bonviva. Boniva 150 mg once-monthly and Boniva 2.5 mg daily are indicated for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Once-monthly Boniva is expected to be available by prescription in U.S. pharmacies in April. Rarely, patients have reported severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain after taking bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis. Additionally, osteonecrosis of the jaw has rarely been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates; most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures. The most commonly reported adverse events with once-monthly Boniva regardless of causality were abdominal pain (Boniva 150 mg 7.8 percent vs. Boniva 2.5 mg 5.3 percent), hypertension (6.3 percent vs. 7.3 percent), dyspepsia (5.6 percent vs. 7.1 percent), arthralgia (5.6 percent vs. 3.5 percent), nausea (5.1 percent vs. 4.8 percent) and diarrhea (5.1 percent vs. 4.1 percent). Patients who take Boniva are eligible to sign up for MyBONIVA, a patient support program designed to help enhance compliance (taking therapy as directed) and persistence (staying on therapy) with this unique once-monthly regimen. For more information on this program call 1-800-4BONIVA. References: For complete prescribing information for Boniva, please visit www.4boniva.com.

These symptoms may be early signs of liver damage or pancreatitis. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor, such as: mood or behavior changes, depression, anxiety, or if you feel agitated, hostile, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. In rare cases, Depakote has caused life-threatening liver failure, especially in children younger than 2 years old. Children of this age may be at even greater risk for liver problems if they use more than one seizure medication, if they have a metabolic disorder, or if they have a brain disease causing mental impairment (such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, or a brain injury or infection). Depakote has also caused rare cases of life-threatening pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Pancreatitis can come on suddenly and symptoms may start even after you have been taking Depakote for several years.

Gardasil is also used to prevent genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11 in boys and young men ages 9 through 26. Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause genital warts, cancer of the cervix, and various cancers of the vulva or vagina. The quadrivalent form of HPV vaccine (Gardasil) is used in both females and males. Another form of HPV vaccine (Cervarix) is used only in females. This medication guide provides information only for Gardasil. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HPV vaccine for all girls ages 11 or 12 years old. The vaccine is also recommended in girls and women ages 13 through 26 years old who have not already received the vaccine or have not completed all booster shots. You may receive Gardasil even if you have already had genital warts, or had a positive HPV test or abnormal pap smear in the past. However, Gardasil will not treat active genital warts or HPV-related cancers, and it will not cure HPV infection. You should not receive a booster Gardasil vaccine if you have had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Before receiving Gardasil, tell your doctor if you have a high fever or signs of infection, a weak immune system, a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia, or if you are taking a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HPV vaccine for all girls ages 11 or 12 years old.

You may receive Gardasil even if you have already had genital warts, or had a positive HPV test or abnormal pap smear in the past. However, Gardasil will not treat active genital warts or HPV-related cancers, and it will not cure HPV infection. You may feel faint after receiving Gardasil. Some people have had seizure-like reactions after receiving this vaccine. Your doctor may want you to remain under observation during the first 15 minutes after the injection. Developing cancer from HPV is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. However, like any medicine, Gardasil can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Gardasil will not protect against sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, HIV, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Before receiving Gardasil, tell your doctor if you have: FDA pregnancy category B. This medication is not expected to be harmful to an unborn baby.

Gardasil is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle in your upper arm or thigh. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting. Gardasil is given in a series of 3 shots. You may have the first shot at any time as long as you are between the ages of 9 and 26 years old. Then you will need to receive a second dose 2 months after your first shot, and a third dose 6 months after your first shot. Be sure to receive all doses of Gardasil recommended by your healthcare provider or your state's health department. You may not be fully protected if you do not receive the full series. Gardasil should not be used in place of having a routine pelvic exam and Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer. Contact your doctor if you will miss an Gardasil booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over. Be sure you receive all recommended doses of Gardasil. If you do not receive the full series of vaccines, you may not be fully protected against the disease. An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur. There may be certain other vaccines that should not be given at the same time as the Gardasil. Until you have completed the series of 3 Gardasils, do not receive any other vaccine (including a flu shot) without first asking your doctor. You should not receive a Gardasil booster vaccine if you have had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.

 Generic Name: hepatitis A adult vaccine (HEP a TYE tis) Brand Names: Havrix, Vaqta Havrix is a hepatitis A vaccine. Hepatitis is a serious disease caused by a virus. Hepatitis A is spread through contact with the stool (bowel movements) of a person infected with the hepatitis A virus. This usually occurs by eating food or drinking water that has become contaminated as a result of handling by an infected person. Hepatitis causes inflammation of the liver, vomiting, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Hepatitis can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis, or death. Havrix adult vaccine is used to help prevent this disease in adults. The vaccine works by exposing you to a small amount of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Havrix will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. Vaccination with Havrix adult vaccine is recommended for all adults who travel in certain areas of the world where hepatitis A is a common disease. Other risk factors for hepatitis include: being a homosexual male; having chronic liver disease; using intravenous (IV) drugs; receiving treatment for hemophilia or other bleeding disorders; working in a research laboratory or around animals (especially monkeys) where you may be exposed to the hepatitis A virus; or being in an area where there has been an outbreak of hepatitis A. Like any vaccine, the Havrix may not provide protection from disease in every person. Havrix will not protect you against infection with hepatitis B, C, and E, or other viruses that affect the liver. It may also not protect you from hepatitis A if you are already infected with the virus, even if you do not yet show symptoms. You will most likely receive 2 separate injections of the Havrix at 6 months apart, depending on your exposure or risk of infection. Children should receive their first Havrix between 12 months and 23 months of age. Your individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in. Vaccination with Havrix adult vaccine is recommended for all adults who travel in certain areas of the world where hepatitis A is a common disease. Other risk factors for hepatitis include: being a homosexual male; having chronic liver disease; using intravenous (IV) drugs; receiving treatment for hemophilia or other bleeding disorders; working in a research laboratory or around animals (especially monkeys) where you may be exposed to the hepatitis A virus; or being in an area where there has been an outbreak of hepatitis A. Be sure you receive all recommended doses of Havrix. If you do not receive the full series of vaccines, you may not be fully protected against the disease. You can still receive a vaccine if you have a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Havrix. You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Havrix. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects. Becoming infected with hepatitis A is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. Like any medicine, Havrix can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Havrix will not protect you against infection with hepatitis B, C, and E, or other viruses that affect the liver. It may also not protect you from hepatitis A if you are already infected with the virus, even if you do not yet show symptoms. You should not receive Havrix if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing hepatitis A, or if you have received cancer chemotherapy or radiation treatment in the past 3 months. Before receiving Havrix, tell your doctor if you have: You can still receive a vaccine if you have a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Havrix. Before receiving the Havrix, tell your doctor if you are pregnant. It is not known if hepatitis A vaccine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. Havrix is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting. You will most likely receive 2 separate injections of the Havrix at 6 months apart, depending on your exposure or risk of infection. To prevent hepatitis A while traveling, you should receive Havrix at least 2 weeks before your trip. Your healthcare provider will determine the best dosing schedule for your situation. Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin-free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours. Follow the label directions or your doctor's instructions about how much of this medicine to take. It is especially important to prevent fever from occurring if you have a seizure disorder such as epilepsy. Contact your doctor if you will miss a Havrix dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over. Be sure to receive all recommended doses of Havrix. If you do not receive the full series of vaccines, you may not be fully protected against the disease. An overdose of Havrix is unlikely to occur. There are no restrictions on food, beverages, or activity before or after receiving Havrix, unless your doctor has told you otherwise. You should not receive a booster vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot of Havrix. Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Havrix. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects. Becoming infected with hepatitis A is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. Like any medicine, Havrix can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects: Less serious Havrix side effects include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report vaccine side effects to the US Department of Health and Human Services at 1-800-822-7967.

Also tell the doctor if you have recently received drugs or treatments that can weaken the immune system, including: If you are using any of these medications, you may not be able to receive the vaccine, or may need to wait until the other treatments are finished. There may be other drugs that can affect Havrix. Tell your doctor about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you have received. This includes vitamins, minerals, herbal products, and drugs prescribed by other doctors. Do not start using a new medication without telling your doctor. Copyright 1996-2010 Cerner Multum, Inc.

HCG is used to cause ovulation and to treat infertility in women, and to increase sperm count in men. HCG is also used in young boys when their testicles have not dropped down into the scrotum normally. This can be caused by a pituitary gland disorder. HCG may also be used for other purposes not listed. HCG is given as an injection under the skin or into a muscle. If you use HCG at home, your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will give you specific instructions on how and where to inject this medicine. Do not self-inject HCG if you do not fully understand how to give the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes. Call your doctor at once if you have any of these signs of a blood clot: pain, warmth, redness, numbness, or tingling in your arm or leg; confusion, extreme dizziness, or severe headache. HCG can cause early puberty in young boys. Call your doctor if a boy using this medicine shows early signs of puberty, such as a deepened voice, pubic hair growth, and increased acne or sweating.

 Generic Name: haemophilus b conjugate (PRP-T) vaccine (hem OFF il us B KON ju gate) Brand Names: ActHIB, Hiberix Hiberix is a brand of haemophilus B vaccine. Haemophilus B is a type of influenza (flu) caused by bacteria. Hiberix is used to prevent infection caused by haemophilus B bacteria, and is sometimes combined with vaccines to protect against other diseases. Haemophilus B vaccine will not protect against other types of influenza. Haemophilus B bacteria can infect the lungs or throat, and can also spread to the blood, bones, joints, brain, or spinal cord. It can cause breathing problems or meningitis, and these infections can be fatal. Haemophilus B disease can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The bacteria can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle, or other surface. The bacteria can also be passed through kissing, or sharing a drinking glass or eating utensil with an infected person. Hiberix works by exposing your child to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Hiberix will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. Hiberix is for use in children between the ages of 2 months and 4 years old. Like any vaccine, Hiberix may not provide protection from disease in every person. Hiberix is given in a series of shots. In most cases, the vaccine is given as 2 separate shots, 2 months apart. A booster dose is then given 2 months after the last shot, or no later than 18 months of age. Your child's individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in. Be sure your child receives all recommended doses of Hiberix. If your child does not receive the full series of vaccines, he or she may not be fully protected against the disease. Your child can still receive a vaccine if he or she has a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until the child gets better before receiving Hiberix. Your child should not receive a booster vaccine if he or she had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Keep track of any and all side effects your child has after receiving Hiberix. When the child receives a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects. Becoming infected with haemophilus B is much more dangerous to your child's health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. Like any medicine, Hiberix can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Your child should not receive Hiberix if he or she has ever had an allergic reaction to a haemophilus B or a tetanus vaccine, or if the child has received cancer chemotherapy or radiation treatment in the past 3 months. Before receiving Hiberix, tell your child's doctor if the child is allergic to any drugs, or has: FDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether Hiberix is harmful to an unborn baby.

Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in. Your child can still receive a vaccine if he or she has a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until the child gets better before receiving Hiberix. Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin-free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours. Follow the label directions or your doctor's instructions about how much of this medicine to give your child. It is especially important to prevent fever from occurring in a child who has a seizure disorder such as epilepsy. Contact your doctor if you will miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over. Be sure your child receives all recommended doses of Hiberix.

 Generic Name: insulin lispro (IN soo lin LISS pro) Brand Names: Humalog Cartridge, KwikPen or Pen Humalog is used to treat type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in adults. Insulin lispro is a fast-acting form of insulin. It is usually given together with another long-acting insulin. It works by lowering levels of glucose in the blood. Humalog is also used together with oral (taken by mouth) medications to treat type 2 (non insulin-dependent) diabetes in adults. Humalog may also be used for other purposes not listed here. Humalog is a fast-acting insulin that begins to work very quickly. If you use this medication with meal, use it within 15 minutes before or just after you eat. Take care to keep your blood sugar from getting too low, causing hypoglycemia. Symptoms of low blood sugar may include headache, nausea, hunger, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, fast heartbeat, sweating, tremor, or trouble concentrating. Carry a piece of non-dietetic hard candy or glucose tablets with you in case you have low blood sugar. Also be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency. Also watch for signs of blood sugar that is too high (hyperglycemia). These symptoms include increased thirst, loss of appetite, increased urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dry skin, and dry mouth. Check your blood sugar levels and ask your doctor how to adjust your insulin doses if needed. Never share an injection pen or cartridge with another person. Sharing injection pens or cartridges can allow disease such as hepatitis or HIV to pass from one person to another. Humalog is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, foot care, eye care, dental care, and testing your blood sugar. Follow your diet, medication, and exercise routines very closely. Changing any of these factors can affect your blood sugar levels. Before using Humalog, tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease. Tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including any oral (by mouth) diabetes medications.

Do not miss any scheduled appointments. Use Humalog exactly as it was prescribed for you. Do not use it in larger amounts or for longer than recommended by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Humalog is given as an injection (shot) under your skin, using a needle and syringe or an insulin pump. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will give you specific instructions on how and where to inject this medicine. Do not self-inject this medicine if you do not fully understand how to give the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes. Humalog should be thin, clear, and colorless. Do not use the medication if it has changed colors or has any particles in it. Call your doctor for a new prescription. Choose a different place in your injection skin area each time you use Humalog. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row. Use each disposable needle only one time. Throw away used needles in a puncture-proof container (ask your pharmacist where you can get one and how to dispose of it). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets. Some insulin needles can be used more than once, depending on needle brand and type. But a reused needle must be properly cleaned, recapped, and inspected for bending or breakage. Reusing needles also increases your risk of infection. Ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you are able to reuse your insulin needles. Infusion pump tubing, catheters, and the needle location on your skin should be changed every 48 hours. Throw away any medication leftover in the reservoir. Never share an injection pen or cartridge with another person. Sharing injection pens or cartridges can allow disease such as hepatitis or HIV to pass from one person to another. Check your blood sugar carefully during a time of stress or illness, if you travel, exercise more than usual, or skip meals. These things can affect your glucose levels and your Humalog dose may also need to change. Watch for signs of blood sugar that is too high (hyperglycemia). These symptoms include increased thirst, loss of appetite, increased urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dry skin, and dry mouth. Check your blood sugar levels and ask your doctor how to adjust your insulin doses if needed. Do not freeze Humalog, and throw away the medication if it has become frozen. Since Humalog is used before meals, you may not be on a timed dosing schedule. Whenever you use Humalog, be sure to eat a meal within 15 minutes. Do not use extra Humalog to make up a missed dose. It is important to keep Humalog on hand at all times. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely. Symptoms of severe hypoglycemia include extreme weakness, blurred vision, sweating, trouble speaking, tremors, stomach pain, confusion, seizure (convulsions), or coma. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is the most common side effect of Humalog. Symptoms of low blood sugar may include headache, nausea, hunger, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, fast heartbeat, sweating, tremor, trouble concentrating, confusion, or seizure (convulsions). Watch for signs of low blood sugar. Carry a piece of non-dietetic hard candy or glucose tablets with you in case you have low blood sugar. Tell your doctor if you have itching, swelling, redness, or thickening of the skin where you inject Humalog. This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.

 Generic Name: etonogestrel (implant) (e toe noe JES trel) Brand Names: Implanon Implanon contains etonogestrel, a hormone that prevents ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary). Etonogestrel also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus. Implanon is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy. The Implanon implant is a small plastic rod that is implanted into the skin of your upper arm. The medicine is released slowly into the body. The rod can remain in place and provide continuous contraception for up to 3 years. Implanon may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide. Do not use Implanon if you are pregnant. If you have recently had a baby, wait at least 3 weeks (4 weeks if breast-feeding) before using an Implanon implant. Do not use this medication if you have any of the following conditions: a history of stroke or blood clot, a history of breast cancer, abnormal vaginal bleeding, liver disease, or liver cancer. Using hormones can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack, especially if you smoke and are older than 35. Before receiving the Implanon implant, tell your doctor if you have an ovarian cyst, heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, gallbladder disease, a seizure disorder, or if you are overweight. Implanon is inserted through a needle into the skin of your upper arm. The medicine is released slowly into the body from the implant. The Implanon implant can remain in place to provide continuous contraception for up to 3 years. You will most likely have irregular and unpredictable periods while using Implanon. Tell your doctor if your periods are very heavy or long-lasting, or if you miss a period (you may be pregnant). If you need to have any type of medical tests or surgery, or if you will be on bed rest, you may need to have the implant removed for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using Implanon. The Implanon implant must be removed by the end of the third year after it was inserted and may be replaced at that time with a new implant. If you choose not to replace the Implanon implant, your ability to get pregnant will return quickly. Start using another form of birth control right away if you wish to avoid an unintended pregnancy. Do not use an Implanon if you are pregnant. If you have recently had a baby, wait at least 3 weeks (4 weeks if breast-feeding) before receiving an Implanon. Do not receive the Implanon implant if you are allergic to etonogestrel, or if you have: Before using this medication, tell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions. You may need special tests to safely use an Implanon. Do not use the implant if you are breast-feeding a baby younger than 4 weeks old. Implanon should not be used in girls younger than 18 years old. Use this medication exactly as it was prescribed for you. Do not use Implanon for longer than recommended by your doctor. The timing of when you will receive this implant depends on whether or not you were using birth control before, and what type it was. Follow your doctor's instructions. The Implanon implant is inserted through a needle into the skin of your upper arm, just inside and above the elbow. The Implanon implant will be placed in your arm under local anesthetic in your doctor's office or other clinic setting. Before receiving this implant, you may need a pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant. This implant must be inserted only by a physician or other healthcare provider who has been specially trained in the insertion of the Implanon implant. Incorrect placement of the rod too deeply can make it difficult or impossible to remove later on. If the rod is incorrectly inserted and falls out, you will not be protected from unintended pregnancy. Once the Implanon implant is inserted, you should be able to feel it under your skin. Tell your doctor if you cannot feel the implant under the skin at any time while it is in place. The medicine is released slowly into the body from the Implanon implant. The implant can remain in place to provide continuous contraception for up to 3 years. If the implant is placed correctly, you will not need to use back-up birth control. Follow your doctor's instructions. After the Implanon implant is inserted, your doctor will cover your arm with two bandages. You may remove the top bandage after 24 hours, but leave the smaller bandage on your arm for 3 to 5 days. Keep the area clean and dry while wearing the bandage. You will most likely have irregular and unpredictable periods while using Implanon. Tell your doctor if your periods are very heavy or long-lasting, or if you miss a period (you may be pregnant). Your doctor will need to see you on a regular basis while you are using this medication. You may also need to have routine mammograms. Do not miss any appointments. If you need to have any type of medical tests or surgery, or if you will be on bed rest, you may need to have the implant removed for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using Implanon. The Implanon implant must be removed by the end of the third year after it was inserted and may be replaced at that time with a new implant. If you choose not to replace the Implanon implant, your ability to get pregnant will return quickly. Some women have become pregnant within the first week after removal of an Implanon implant. Start using another form of birth control right away if you wish to avoid an unintended pregnancy. Do not use Implanon implants for longer than recommended by your doctor. Since Implanon is inserted under the skin and remains in place for up to 3 years, you will not be on a dosing schedule. Be sure to see your doctor for removal of the Implanon implant by the end of the third year. If the implant is correctly inserted, an overdose of etonogestrel is highly unlikely. Overdose symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. Do not smoke while using Implanon, especially if you are older than 35. Smoking can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack caused by Implanon. Implanon will not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases--including HIV and AIDS. Using a condom is the only way to protect yourself from these diseases. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction to Implanon: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects: Less serious Implanon side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

Janumet is not for treating type 1 diabetes. Janumet may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. You should not use Janumet if you are allergic to metformin (Glucophage) or sitagliptin (Januvia), if you have liver or kidney disease, or if you are in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment with insulin).

 Back to FDA Approvals Juvederm is natural, biodegradable and currently the only approved hyaluronic acid dermal filler that has demonstrated its safety and effectiveness in patients of all skin types and colors. Juvederm also is the only hyaluronic acid dermal filler developed using a proprietary, technologically advanced manufacturing process that results in a malleable smooth gel that flows easily into the skin, creating a smooth, natural look and feel. All other currently approved hyaluronic acid dermal fillers utilize a gel particle suspension formulation. The Juvederm family of products offers the highest concentration of cross-linked hyaluronic acid available in a dermal filler, which results in a long duration of effect and may be attributed to the majority of patients not requiring touch-ups following their initial treatment. The smooth consistency of the Juvederm formula also may help to minimize the discomfort that can sometimes occur during the injection procedure. The FDA approved three different formulations for Juvederm providing physicians with the flexibility to tailor each treatment to the particular needs of the patient. The three product formulations include: Juvederm 24HV, a highly cross-linked formulation for more versatility in contouring and volumizing of facial wrinkles and folds; Juvederm 30HV, a more highly cross-linked robust formulation for volumizing and correction of deeper folds and wrinkles; and Juvederm 30, a highly cross-linked formulation for subtle correction of facial wrinkles and folds. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers represent the fastest growing non-invasive aesthetic procedure in the United States. Occurring naturally in the body, hyaluronic acid is a natural complex sugar found in all living organisms and creates volume and elasticity in the skin. Juvederm adds volume to facial wrinkles, such as nasolabial folds (the folds running from the sides of the bottom of the nose to the outer corners of the mouth). Hyaluronic acid treats multiple medical conditions, including those associated with the eye and the knee, and has been used for more than 20 years. The FDA's approval of Juvederm was based on data from a double-blind, randomized and controlled clinical trial. A total of 439 subjects were followed for six months after injection with one of three Juvederm formulations in one nasolabial fold, and Zyplast (bovine-based collagen) in the other. Juvederm was found to provide a more persistent wrinkle correction than Zyplast over the 6-month course of the study, with up to 90% of subjects maintaining at least a 1-grade improvement in nasolabial fold correction with Juvederm compared to 36-45% with Zyplast. At the conclusion of the study, up to 88% of subjects expressed a preference for Juvederm while only 5-12% expressed a preference for Zyplast. In addition, among non-Caucasian patients (all Fitzpatrick Skin Types), Juvederm was found safe and effective and demonstrated no increased risk of hyperpigmentation or hypertrophic scarring. In clinical studies, Juvederm adverse events were usually mild to moderate in nature, did not require intervention and lasted seven days or less. The most common Juvederm side effects included temporary injection site reactions including redness, pain/tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps and bumps and bruising. Source: Allergan, Inc.

Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems. High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, and by certain medicines when necessary. Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood. Cholesterol comes from two sources. It is produced by your body and it comes from the food you eat. Your total cholesterol is made up of both LDL and HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is called "bad" cholesterol because it can build up in the wall of your arteries and form plaque, which can slow or block blood flow to your heart, brain, and other organs. HDL cholesterol is called "good" cholesterol because it keeps the bad cholesterol from building up in the arteries. Triglycerides also are fats found in your body.

 Generic Name: diphtheria, pertussis acellular, tetanus, and polio vaccine (dif THEER ee a, per TUS is a SEL yoo lar, TET a nus, POE lee oh) Brand Names: Kinrix Kinrix is a diphtheria, pertussis acellular, tetanus, and polio vaccine. Diphtheria, pertussis acellular, tetanus, and polio are serious diseases caused by bacteria. Diphtheria causes a thick coating in the nose, throat, and airway. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, or death. Pertussis (whooping cough) causes coughing so severe that it interferes with eating, drinking, or breathing. These spells can last for weeks and can lead to pneumonia, seizures (convulsions), brain damage, and death. Tetanus (lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to "locking" of the jaw so the victim cannot open the mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in about 1 out of 10 cases. Polio affects the central nervous system and spinal cord. It can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. Polio is a life-threatening condition because it can paralyze the muscles that help you breathe. Diphtheria, pertussis, and polio are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound. Kinrix is used to help prevent these diseases in children who are ages 4 through 6 years (before the 7th birthday) who have received prior vaccination with a DTaP and IPV series. Kinrix works by exposing your child to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Kinrix will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. Like any vaccine, Kinrix may not provide protection from disease in every person. Kinrix is given as the 5th dose in a series of DTaP immunizations and the 4th dose in a series of IPV immunizations. The shot is usually given to a child who is at least 4 years old or has not yet reached his or her 7th birthday. Your child's individual dose schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in. Be sure your child receives all recommended doses in the DTaP and IPV series. If your child does not receive the full series of vaccines, he or she may not be fully protected against the disease. Your child can still receive a Kinrix vaccine if he or she has a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until the child gets better before receiving Kinrix. Keep track of any and all side effects your child has after receiving Kinrix. If the child ever needs to receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects. Becoming infected with diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, or polio is much more dangerous to your child's health than receiving the Kinrix vaccine to protect against these diseases. Like any medicine, Kinrix can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Your child may not be able to receive Kinrix if he or she has ever received a similar vaccine that caused any of the following within 48 hours: Before receiving Kinrix, tell the doctor if your child has: Your child can still receive a Kinrix vaccine if he or she has a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until the child gets better before receiving Kinrix. Kinrix is given as an injection into a muscle. Your child will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting. Kinrix is given as the 5th dose in a series of DTaP immunizations and the 4th dose in a series of IPV immunizations. The shot is usually given to a child who is at least 4 years old or has not yet reached his or her 7th birthday. Your child's individual dose schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in. Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin-free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours. Follow the label directions or your doctor's instructions about how much of this medicine to give your child. Contact your doctor if you will miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over. Be sure your child receives all recommended doses in the DTaP and IPV series. If your child does not receive the full series of vaccines, he or she may not be fully protected against the disease. An overdose of Kinrix is unlikely to occur. Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity after receiving the Kinrix vaccine. Keep track of any and all side effects your child has after receiving Kinrix. If the child ever needs to receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects. Becoming infected with diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, or polio is much more dangerous to your child's health than receiving the vaccine to protect against these diseases. Like any medicine, Kinrix can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Call your doctor at once if the child has any of these serious side effects: Less serious Kinrix side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Tell your doctor about any unusual or bothersome side effect. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

 Generic Name: insulin glargine (IN soo lin GLAR jeen) Brand Names: Lantus, Lantus OptiClik Cartridge, Lantus Solostar Pen Lantus (insulin glargine) is a man-made form of a hormone that is produced in the body. It works by lowering levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Lantus is a long-acting form of insulin that is slightly different from other forms of insulin that are not man-made. Lantus is used to treat type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 (non insulin-dependent) diabetes. Lantus may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. Lantus is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, foot care, eye care, dental care, and testing your blood sugar. Follow your diet, medication, and exercise routines very closely. Changing any of these factors can affect your blood sugar levels. Take care not to let your blood sugar get too low. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can occur if you skip a meal, exercise too long, drink alcohol, or are under stress. Symptoms include headache, hunger, weakness, sweating, tremors, irritability, or trouble concentrating. Carry hard candy or glucose tablets with you in case you have low blood sugar. Other sugar sources include orange juice and milk. Be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency. Also watch for signs of blood sugar that is too high (hyperglycemia). These symptoms include increased thirst, increased urination, hunger, dry mouth, fruity breath odor, drowsiness, dry skin, blurred vision, and weight loss. Your blood sugar will need to be checked often, and you may need to adjust your Lantus dose. Do not use Lantus if you are allergic to insulin glargine. To make sure you can safely take Lantus, tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease. FDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether Lantus is harmful to an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment. It is not known whether insulin glargine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby.

You should not mix Lantus with other insulins. Lantus should be a thin, clear, and colorless liquid. Do not use the medication if it has changed colors or has any particles in it. Call your doctor for a new prescription. Use a different place in your injection skin area each time you give the Lantus injection. Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject the medication. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row. Use a disposable needle only once. Throw away used needles in a puncture-proof container (ask your pharmacist where you can get one and how to dispose of it). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets. The Lantus SoloStar injection pen contains a total of 300 units of insulin. The pen is designed to deliver from 1 to 80 units with each press of the injection button. Do not press the button more than one time per injection unless your doctor has prescribed a dose greater than 80 units. Never share a Lantus injection pen or cartridge with another person. Sharing injection pens or cartridges can allow disease such as hepatitis or HIV to pass from one person to another. Your blood sugar will need to be checked often, and you may need other blood tests at your doctor's office. Visit your doctor regularly. Your dose needs may change if you become ill, have a fever or infection, or if you have surgery or a medical emergency. Your doctor may want you to stop taking Lantus for a short time if any of these situations affect you. Ask your doctor how to adjust your Lantus dose if needed. Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice. Know the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and how to recognize them: headache, hunger, weakness, sweating, tremors, irritability, or trouble concentrating.

Your body may absorb more lidocaine if you use too much, if you apply it over large skin areas, or if you apply heat, bandages, or plastic wrap to treated skin areas.

 Generic Name: methadone (METH a done) Brand names: Diskets, Dolophine, Methadose, Methadose Sugar-Free Methadone is a narcotic pain reliever, similar to morphine. It also reduces withdrawal symptoms in people addicted to heroin or other narcotic drugs without causing the "high" associated with the drug addiction. Methadone is used as a pain reliever and as part of drug addiction detoxification and maintenance programs. Methadone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. Taking methadone improperly will increase your risk of serious side effects or death. Even if you have used other narcotic medications, you may still have serious side effects from methadone. Follow all dosing instructions carefully. Like other narcotic medicines, methadone can slow your breathing, even long after the pain-relieving effects of the medication wear off. Death may occur if breathing becomes too weak. Never use more methadone than your doctor has prescribed. Call your doctor if you think the medicine is not working. Do not stop using methadone suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Call your doctor if you miss doses or forget to take this medication for longer than 3 days in a row. Do not drink alcohol. Methadone can increase the effects of alcohol, which could be dangerous. Check your food and medicine labels to be sure these products do not contain alcohol. Methadone may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert.

Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain. Like other narcotic medicines, methadone can slow your breathing, even long after the pain-relieving effects of the medication wear off. Death may occur if breathing becomes too weak. Never use more methadone than your doctor has prescribed. Call your doctor if you think the medicine is not working. When methadone is used as part of a treatment program for drug addiction or detoxification, you will receive the medication through a clinic or special pharmacy. Your doctor may recommend that methadone be given to you by a family member or other caregiver. This is to make sure you are using the medicine as it was prescribed as part of your treatment. Additional forms of counseling and/or monitoring may be recommended during treatment with methadone. Methadone is available in tablets, dispersible tablets, oral solution (liquid) and as an injection. The pill and oral liquid forms of methadone must never be used to make a methadone injection. Measure the liquid form of methadone with a special dose-measuring spoon or cup, not a regular table spoon. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one. The methadone dispersible tablet (Diskets) is made to be dissolved in water. Do not chew, crush, or swallow the tablet whole. Place the tablet into a 4-ounce glass of water, orange juice, or other citrus-flavored non-alcoholic beverage and allow the tablet to disperse in the liquid. The tablet will not dissolve completely. Drink this mixture right away. To make sure you get the entire dose, add a little more liquid to the same glass, swirl gently and drink right away. Store methadone at room temperature away from moisture and heat. After you have stopped using methadone, flush any unused pills down the toilet. Disposal of medicines by flushing is recommended to reduce the danger of accidental overdose causing death. This advice applies to a very small number of medicines only. The FDA, working with the manufacturer, has determined this method to be the most appropriate route of disposal and presents the least risk to human safety.

Tell your doctor about any unusual or bothersome side effect. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. See also: Methadone side effects (in more detail) Usual Adult Dose for Pain: Oral: 2.5 to 10 mg every 3 to 12 hours. IV, IM, subcutaneously: 2.5 to 10 mg every 3 to 6 hours. Usual Adult Dose of Methadone for Opiate Withdrawal: Initial Dose: 15 to 40 mg once a day. The oral route is preferred unless the patient is unable to ingest oral methadone, then parenteral form can be used. 5 to 10 mg additional doses may be given if symptoms of abstinence are distressing. After one or two days, a 20% daily reduction in dose can usually be tolerated. Detoxification can usually be completed within 10 days. Maintenance of opiate dependence: 20 to 120 mg/day. Oral - Diskets: Induction/Initial Dosing: The initial methadone dose should be administered, under supervision, when there are no signs of sedation or intoxication, and the patient shows symptoms of withdrawal. Initial dose: a single dose of 20 to 30 mg of methadone will often be sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms. The initial dose should not exceed 30 mg. If same day dosing adjustments are to be made, the patient should be asked to wait two to four hours for further evaluation, when peak levels have been reached. An additional 5 to 10 mg of methadone may be provided if withdrawal symptoms have not been suppressed or if symptoms reappear. The total daily dose of methadone on the first day of treatment should not ordinarily exceed 40 mg. Dose adjustments should be made over the first week of treatment based on control of withdrawal symptoms at the time of expected peak activity (e.g., 2 to 4 hours after dosing). Dose adjustment should be cautious; deaths have occurred in early treatment due to the cumulative effects of the first several days dosing. Because diskets can be administered only in 10 mg increments, diskets may not be the appropriate product for initial dosing in many patients. Patients should be reminded that the dose will "hold" for a longer period of time as tissue stores of methadone accumulate. Initial doses should be lower for patients whose tolerance is expected to be low at treatment entry. Loss of tolerance should be considered in any patient who has not taken opioids for more than five days. Initial doses should not be determined by previous treatment episodes or dollars spent per day on illicit drug use. For Short-term Detoxification: For patients preferring a brief course of stabilization followed by a period of medically supervised withdrawal, it is generally recommended that the patient be titrated to a total daily dose of about 40 mg in divided doses to achieve an adequate stabilizing level. Stabilization can be continued for 2 to 3 days, after which the dose of methadone should be gradually decreased. The rate at which methadone is decreased should be determined separately for each patient. The dose of methadone can be decreased on a daily basis or at two day intervals, but the amount of intake should remain sufficient to keep withdrawal symptoms at a tolerable level. In hospitalized patients, a daily reduction of 20% of the total daily dose may be tolerated. In ambulatory patients, a somewhat slower schedule may be needed. Because diskets can be administered only in 10 mg increments, diskets may not be the appropriate product for gradual dose reduction in many patients. For Maintenance Treatment: Patients in maintenance treatment should be titrated to a dose at which opioid symptoms are prevented for 24 hours, drug hunger or craving is reduced, the euphoric effects of self-administered opioids are blocked or attenuated, and the patient is tolerant to the sedative effects of methadone. Most commonly, clinical stability is achieved at doses between 80 to 120 mg/day. For Medically Supervised Withdrawal After a Period of Maintenance Treatment: There is considerable variability in the appropriate rate of methadone taper in patients choosing medically supervised withdrawal from methadone treatment. It is generally suggested that dose reductions should be less than 10% of the established tolerance or maintenance dose, and that 10 to 14 day intervals should elapse between dose reductions. Because diskets can be administered only in 10 mg increments, it may not be the appropriate product for gradual dose reduction in many patients. Patients should be apprised of the high risk of relapse to illicit drug use associated with discontinuation of methadone maintenance treatment. Usual Pediatric Methadone Dose for Pain: Note: Doses should be titrated to appropriate effects: Neonatal abstinence syndrome: Oral or IV: Initial: 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose given every 12 to 24 hours or 0.5 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours. Individualize dose and tapering schedule to control symptoms of withdrawal. Usually taper dose by 10 to 20% per week over 1 to 1 and 1/2 months. Note: Due to long elimination half-life, tapering is difficult; consider alternate agent. Note: Doses should be titrated to appropriate effects: Children: Analgesia: Note: Dosing interval may range from 4 to 12 hours during initial therapy. Decrease in dose or frequency may be required approximately 2 to 5 days after initiation of therapy or dosage increase due to accumulation with repeated doses. IV: Initial: 0.1 mg/kg/dose every 4 hours for 2 to 3 doses, then every 6 to 12 hours as needed Maximum dose: 10 mg/dose Oral, IM, SubQ: Initial: 0.1 mg/kg/dose every 4 hours for 2 to 3 doses, then every 6 to 12 hours as needed or 0.7 mg/kg/24 hours divided every 4 to 6 hours as needed Maximum dose: 10 mg/doseIatrogenic narcotic dependency: Oral: Controlled studies have not been conducted. Several clinically used dosing regimens have been reported. Methadone dose must be individualized and will depend upon the previous narcotic dose and severity of opioid withdrawal. Patients who have received higher doses of narcotics will require higher methadone doses. General guidelines: Initial: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours Increase by 0.05 mg/kg/dose until withdrawal symptoms are controlled. After 24 to 48 hours, the dosing interval can be lengthened to every 12 to 24 hours. To taper dose, wean by 0.05 mg/kg/day. If withdrawal symptoms recur, taper at a slower rate. Do not use methadone with other narcotic pain medications, sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxers, or other medicines that can make you sleepy or slow your breathing. Dangerous side effects may result. Do not use methadone with any of the following drugs without first talking to your doctor: This list is not complete and there are many other drugs that can interact with methadone. Tell your doctor about all medications you use. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products. Do not start a new medication without telling your doctor. Keep a list of all your medicines and show it to any healthcare provider who treats you.

NovoLog may also be used for other purposes not listed. NovoLog is a fast-acting insulin that begins to work very quickly. After using it, you should eat a meal within 5 to 10 minutes. Take care to keep your blood sugar from getting too low, causing hypoglycemia. Symptoms of low blood sugar may include headache, nausea, hunger, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, fast heartbeat, sweating, tremor, or trouble concentrating. Carry a piece of non-dietetic hard candy or glucose tablets with you in case you have low blood sugar. Also be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency. Also watch for signs of blood sugar that is too high (hyperglycemia). These symptoms include increased thirst, loss of appetite, fruity breath odor, increased urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dry skin, and dry mouth. Check your blood sugar levels and ask your doctor how to adjust your insulin doses if needed Never share an injection pen or cartridge with another person. Sharing injection pens or cartridges can allow disease such as hepatitis or HIV to pass from one person to another.

Oxybutynin can cause side effects that may impair your vision or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert and able to see clearly.

Methaqualone is an anxiolytic and a sedative-hypnotic drug. Quaaludes were introduced as a safe barbiturate substitute, but they later showed that the possibility of addiction and withdrawal symptoms were similar to those of barbiturates. Quaaludes were first synthesized in India in 1950's. It was introduced into America in the 1960's and by the late 1960's it became a popular recreational drug. The abuse potential of Quaaludes soon became apparent and in 1973 methaqualone was placed in Schedule II, making it difficult to prescribe and illegal to possess without a prescription. In 1984 it was moved to Federal Schedule I, so Quaaludes are no longer legally available in the United States. Quaaludes that are sold for recreational use now are synthesized in illegal laboratories. Illegally produced Quaaludes can contain other central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines. In the 1960s a methaqualone and diphenhydramine combination pill called Mandrax was sold as a sedative. Current Mandrax pills, made illegally, may also contain benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ephedrine, etc. Mandrax is still widely abused in South Africa. In prescribed doses, Quaaludes promotes relaxation, sleepiness and sometimes a feeling of euphoria. It causes a drop in blood pressure and slows the pulse rate. These properties are the reason why it was initially thought to be a useful sedative and anxiolytic. In 1972, Quaaludes were one of the most prescribed sedatives in United States. It became a recreational drug due to its euphoric effect. Quaaludes were a popular drug of abuse during much of the 1970s, even though both the United States and Britain tightened control around their use and dispensing. "Luding out" where Quaaludes were taken with wine, became a popular college pastime. When it was a legal medicine, methaqualone was available in tablet and capsule form and came in different strengths. Oral Quaaludes dosages was 75-150mg for light sedation. A common prescribed dose was 300mg. Up to 600mg was used for strong sedation. Tolerance develops rapidly and some users may take up to 2000mg daily to achieve the same effects. Onset of action is approximately 30 minutes after taking Quaaludes and duration of action is between 5 to 8 hours. Overdose of Quaaludes can lead to seizures, coma or death. Taking doses of over 300mg can be dangerous for first time users. Depending on the state of the user's tolerance, doses of about 8,000mg per day can be fatal and others on even higher doses (of up to 20,000mg) may survive. Death can result at much lower doses if Quaaludes are taken with alcohol, which is also a central nervous system depressant. Quaaludes are not recommended during pregnancy as the effects on human fetal development are not clear. There is no data available about the effects of Quaaludes in breastfeeding. Quaaludes should not be taken with alcohol or with other central nervous system depressants. This increases the depressant effects and depending on the doses taken it can be fatal. Do not drive or operate machinery while taking Quaaludes. Common side effects of Quaaludes include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fatigue, itching, rashes, sweating, dry mouth, tingling sensation in arms and legs, seizures and its depressant effects include reduced heart rate and respiration. Quaaludes can also cause erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasms. At high doses it can cause mental confusion and loss of muscle control (ataxia). This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Abuse of Quaaludes creates a barbiturate-type dependence. It is highly addictive and frequent users build a tolerance to it. Quaaludes can cause withdrawal symptoms similar to barbiturates, including restlessness, irritability, nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, insomnia, tremors, mental confusion, seizures, etc. When it was used legally, it was found that Quaaludes users were affected negatively or dying more because of the accidents they were in, due to poor decisions made while under its influence. Driving skills of Quaalude users are impaired and can cause fatal accidents. Copyright 1996-2010 Drugs.com, Inc. Version: 1.01. Revision Date: 11/12/2010 12:03:34 PM.

Treatment for: Postherpetic Neuralgia The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Qutenza (capsaicin) 8% patch for the management of neuropathic pain due to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), the nerve pain which can follow shingles. Qutenza delivers a synthetic form of capsaicin, the substance in chili peppers that gives them their heat sensation, through a dermal delivery system, providing up to 12 weeks of reduced pain following a single one-hour application. Qutenza works by targeting certain pain nerves in the area of skin where pain is being experienced. The Qutenza patch is applied by a physician or a healthcare professional. Clinical studies have shown that PHN pain can be reduced for up to 12 weeks following a single one-hour treatment. Up to four patches may be used and patches may be cut to conform to the size and shape of the painful area. Qutenza is a locally-acting, non-narcotic medication that is unlikely to cause drowsiness or have drug-drug interactions. Treatment with Qutenza may be repeated every three or more months as warranted by the return of pain. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were application site redness, pain, itching, and papules. The majority of these reactions were transient and self limited. Among patients treated with Qutenza, one percent discontinued prematurely due to an adverse event. Serious adverse reactions included application site pain and increased blood pressure. Increases in blood pressure occurred during or shortly after exposure to Qutenza. The changes were on average less than 10 mm Hg, although some patients had greater increases and these changes lasted for approximately two hours after patch removal. Qutenza is a TRPV1 channel agonist indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Qutenza patch contains 8% capsaicin (640 mcg/cm2). Each patch contains a total of 179 mg of capsaicin. None The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and greater than control) are application site erythema, application site pain, application site pruritus and application site papules.

Seasonique is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy. Seasonique may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. You may need to use back-up birth control when you first start using Seasonique. Some drugs can make Seasonique less effective, which may result in pregnancy.

 Generic Name: benzyl alcohol lotion 5% Date of Approval: April 9, 2009 Company: Sciele Pharma, Inc. Treatment for: Head Lice The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Ulesfia, the first and only prescription medication that kills head lice by asphyxiation without potential neurotoxic side effects. Each year, approximately 6 to 12 million children between the ages of 3 and 12 years are infested with head lice. To survive, lice breathe through sophisticated spiracles that close upon contact with most liquids, allowing the lice to go into suspended animation and survive for hours without respiration. Benzyl alcohol prevents lice from closing their spiracles, thereby asphyxiating them within ten minutes and causing death. Read the Patient Information that comes with Ulesfia before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Note: For use on scalp hair and scalp only Ulesfia is a prescription medicine used to get rid of lice in scalp hair of children and adults. It is not known if Ulesfia is safe for children under 6 months of age or in people over age 60. Once Ulesfia is washed off, a fine-tooth comb may be used to remove treated lice and nits from the hair and scalp. All personal items exposed to the hair or lice should be washed in hot water or dry-cleaned. See "How do I stop the spread of lice?" at the end of this leaflet. Tell your healthcare provider if your baby was born early so your healthcare provider can decide if your infant is old enough for Ulesfia. Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: People using Ulesfia may have skin or eye: These are not all the side effects of Ulesfia. For more information, ask your healthcare provider. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1800-FDA-1088.

Botulinum toxin blocks nerve activity in the muscles, causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity. Xeomin is used to treat cervical dystonia (severe spasms in the neck muscles) and certain eye muscle conditions caused by nerve disorders. This includes uncontrolled blinking or spasm of the eyelids, and a condition in which the eyes do not point in the same direction. Xeomin is also used to temporarily lessen the appearance of facial wrinkles. Xeomin may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide. The botulinum toxin contained in Xeomin can spread to other body areas beyond where it was injected. This has caused serious life-threatening side effects in some people receiving botulism toxin injections, even for cosmetic purposes. Call your doctor at once if you have a hoarse voice, drooping eyelids, vision problems, severe muscle weakness, loss of bladder control, or trouble breathing, talking, or swallowing. Some of these effects can occur up to several weeks after a Xeomin injection. Do not seek botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time. If you switch healthcare providers, be sure to tell your new provider how long it has been since your last botulinum toxin injection.

 Generic Name: zoster vaccine live (ZOS ter vak SEEN LYV) Brand Names: Zostavax Zostavax is used to prevent herpes zoster virus (shingles) in people age 50 and older. Herpes zoster is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox in children. When this virus becomes active again in an adult, it can cause herpes zoster, or shingles. Zostavax is a live vaccine that helps prevent shingles. Zostavax works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Zostavax will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. Zostavax will not treat shingles or nerve pain caused by shingles (post-herpetic neuralgia). Zostavax may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. You can still receive a vaccine if you have a minor cold. If you have tuberculosis, or any other severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Zostavax. You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Zostavax. If you ever need to receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects. Becoming infected with herpes zoster (shingles) is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine. However, like any medicine, Zostavax can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Do not receive Zostavax if you have leukemia or lymphoma (or other cancer affecting bone marrow), a history of allergic reaction to neomycin (Mycifradin, Neo-Fradin, Neo-Tab). You should not receive Zostavax if you are pregnant, or if you have active untreated tuberculosis, any type of cancer that affects bone marrow, or a weak immune system caused by disease (such as HIV or AIDS) or by receiving medications such as steroids or chemotherapy. You should not receive Zostavax if you have: To make sure you can safely receive Zostavax, tell your doctor if you have any of these other conditions: You can still receive a vaccine if you have a minor cold. If you have tuberculosis, or any other severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Zostavax. FDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether Zostavax is harmful to an unborn baby. However, this vaccine is not for use in women of child-bearing age and should not be given to a pregnant woman. It is not known whether Zostavax passes into breast milk, or if it could harm a nursing baby. Do not use this medication without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. Zostavax should not be given to a child. See also: Zostavax pregnancy and breastfeeding warnings (in more detail) Zostavax is given as an injection under the skin. You will receive Zostavax in a doctor's office or other clinic setting. Zostavax is usually given as a one-time injection. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, you will not need a booster vaccine. You may receive other vaccines at the same time you receive Zostavax. Since Zostavax is given as a one-time injection, you are not likely to be on a dosing schedule. An overdose of Zostavax is unlikely to occur. If you need to receive a "live" vaccine, wait at least 4 weeks after your zoster vaccine to receive the live vaccine. Live vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), oral polio, chickenpox (varicella), typhoid, BCG (Bacillus Calmette and Guérin), and nasal flu vaccine. You should not receive a pneumonia vaccine (Pneumovax 23) within 4 weeks before or after receiving your Zostavax vaccine. After receiving Zostavax, if you develop a skin rash that looks like shingles, avoid coming into contact with other people who have never had chickenpox (especially newborns, pregnant women, or someone with a weak immune system). Also avoid contact with these individuals if you develop a rash or other reaction where the vaccine was injected into your skin. You should not receive a second Zostavax if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Zostavax. If you ever need to receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects. Becoming infected with shingles is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. Like any medicine, Zostavax can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
